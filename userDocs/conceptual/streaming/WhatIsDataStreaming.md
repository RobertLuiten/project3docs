# What Is Streaming Data?

In this article, we will discuss what streaming data is.

## Temporal Data

Sometimes, data is temporal in the sense that it changes over time. Temporal data can be useful for anaylsis in a variety of situations. For example, hink of a bus route; sometimes we may want to anaylize the positions of buses at a certain time step to find whether some routes are overstaffed at certain times.

Project3 accounts for this by supporting data streaming, meaning that you can easily anaylize streaming network data both from a file and in real-time.
