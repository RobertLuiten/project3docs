# Network Anaylisis With Project3

In this article, we will discuss the importance of network anaylsis along with how Project3 supports it.

## What Is Network Anaylsis?

Network Anaylsis is a tool that studies the relationships between nodes and edges in a network. Whether you realize it or not, we use network anaylsis everyday: for example, when Google Maps finds the shortest route to your destination while driving, it's anaylizing the road network to find the shortest possible path.

## Anaylizing Networks With Project3

Project3 makes network anaylisis easy for both experienced and inexperineced users, which allows you to make the most out of your data.

### Querying With Cypher
Since Project3 works with Neo4j, integrated Cypher querying allows you to quickly visualize your query and anaylsis results. This means that you can do the same Cypher queries you would before, just with instant results with multilayer data. Since Project3 has live data streaming support as well, queries can be set to update in real time. If you wish to learn more about querying with Cypher in Project3, we recommend refering to our [Cypher Querying article here](userDocs/howto/querying/CypherQuerying.md).
