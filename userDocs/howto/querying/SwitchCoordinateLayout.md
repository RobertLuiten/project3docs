3. A message labeled "Rendering with new layout..." will appear while data populates.
4. After a moment, the data with the new layout will be rendered on screen.

## Types Of Layouts & Geocoordinate Data

Project3 has the following layout types:
- Default (the default geocoordinates of the data).
- Random
- Circle
- Fruchterman-Riengold
- Star
- Grid
- Drl
- Kamada Kawaii
- Graphopt
- Davidson Harel
- Sugiyama

The option for the "Default" layout will only be present if you're using geocoordinated data. For more information on adding data with geocoordinates to Project3, refer to [this Project3 article on using Geocoordinates](CoordinatesGeodata.md).
