# How To Switch Layout Of Network Data

In this article, we will discuss how to switch the coordinate layout for network data in Project3.

1. Click the Layout Selector to reveal the current list of available layout options.
2. From the dropdown, click your desired layout option.
3. A message labeled "Rendering with new layout..." will appear while data populates.
4. After a moment, the data with the new layout will be rendered on screen.

## Types Of Layouts & Geocoordinate Data

Project3 has the following layout types:
- Default (the default geocoordinates of the data).
- Random
- Circle
- Fruchterman-Riengold
- Star
- Grid
- Drl
- Kamada Kawaii
- Graphopt
- Davidson Harel
- Sugiyama

The option for the "Default" layout will only be present if you're using geocoordinated data. For more information on adding data with geocoordinates to Project3, we recommend referring to [this Project3 article](CoordinatesGeodata.md).
