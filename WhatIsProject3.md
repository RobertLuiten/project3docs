# What Is Project3?

Project3 is a tool for anaylizing and visualizing networks, with a particular focus on multilayer and streaming data. In this article, we will define some key terms along with some potential use cases for Project3.

## What Are Networks?

There are several networks that we use in our everyday lives: computer networks form the foudation of the internet, 

Networks are made of two primary components: "Nodes" and "Edges". A "Node"
