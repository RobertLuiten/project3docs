# What Is Project3?

Project3 is a tool for anaylizing and visualizing networks, with a particular focus on multilayer and streaming data. In this article, we will define some key terms, list some potential use cases, and provide resources to get you ready for your Project3 journey.
## What Are Networks?

### Network
As mentioned above, the primary purpose of Project3 is to assist you in visualizing and anaylzing networks. A Network is a 


There are several networks that we use in our everyday lives: computer networks form the foudation of the internet, 

Networks are made of two primary components: "Nodes" and "Edges". A "Node"

### Node
A Node is a connection point 

### Edge
An Edge is a



## What Are Multilayer Networks?
Multilayer networks are similar to the aforementioned networks, but with one big difference: a node can be a part of multiple networks.

Take for example a public transportation network. A city may have many methods for public transportation, such as buses, lightrails, and ferries. Each of these could be represented by their own network, where nodes are stops and edges are the routes between stops.

However, some stops may have mutliple modes of transportations that use it. For example, a node representing a train station could be part of both a bus network if a bus stops there and a train network. Each network could be thought of a "layer" in the graph, and each node that the bus and train networks share a connection point.

Since networks of this type can be infinately deep, it makes anaylsis of them somehwat challenging.
